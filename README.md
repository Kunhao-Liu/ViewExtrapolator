# ViewExtrapolator: Novel View Extrapolation with Video Diffusion Priors

## [Project page](https://kunhao-liu.github.io/ViewExtrapolator/) |  [Paper]()

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper: [Novel View Extrapolation with Video Diffusion Priors](). We introduce ViewExtrapolator, a novel approach that leverages the generative priors of Stable Video Diffusion for novel view extrapolation, where the novel views lie far beyond the range of the training views.
